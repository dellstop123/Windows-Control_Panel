# Windows-Control_Panel

As a Python developer, it is handy to use third-party libraries that does the job you actually want, instead of reinventing the wheel each time. In this tutorial, you will be familiar with psutil which is cross-platform library for process and system monitoring in Python, as well as built-in platform module to extract your system and hardware information in Python.

Here is the table of content of this tutorial:

    1. System Information
    2. Boot Information
    3. Memory Information
    4. Network Information
    5. Disk Information
    6. CPU Information

Before we dive in, you need to install psutil:

pip3 install psutil

Open up a new python file and let's get started, importing necessary modules:

    import psutil
    import platform
    from datetime import datetime

Let's make a function that converts large number of bytes into a scaled format (e.g in kilo, mega, giga, etc.):

     def get_size(bytes, suffix="B"):
    """
    Scale bytes to its proper format
    e.g:
        1253656 => '1.20MB'
        1253656678 => '1.17GB'
    """
    factor = 1024
    for unit in ["", "K", "M", "G", "T", "P"]:
        if bytes < factor:
            return f"{bytes:.2f}{unit}{suffix}"
        bytes /= factor

# System Information

We gonna need platform module here:

    print("="*40, "System Information", "="*40)
    uname = platform.uname()
    print(f"System: {uname.system}")
    print(f"Node Name: {uname.node}")
    print(f"Release: {uname.release}")
    print(f"Version: {uname.version}")
    print(f"Machine: {uname.machine}")
    print(f"Processor: {uname.processor}")

# Boot Time Information

Getting the date and time the computer was booted:

    print("="*40, "Boot Time", "="*40)
    boot_time_timestamp = psutil.boot_time()
    bt = datetime.fromtimestamp(boot_time_timestamp)
    print(f"Boot Time: {bt.year}/{bt.month}/{bt.day} {bt.hour}:{bt.minute}:{bt.second}")

# CPU Information

Let's get some CPU information, such as total number of cores, usage, etc:

    print("="*40, "CPU Info", "="*40)
    print("Physical cores:", psutil.cpu_count(logical=False))
    print("Total cores:", psutil.cpu_count(logical=True))
    cpufreq = psutil.cpu_freq()
    print(f"Max Frequency: {cpufreq.max:.2f}Mhz")
    print(f"Min Frequency: {cpufreq.min:.2f}Mhz")
    print(f"Current Frequency: {cpufreq.current:.2f}Mhz")
    print("CPU Usage Per Core:")
    for i, percentage in enumerate(psutil.cpu_percent(percpu=True, interval=1)):
        print(f"Core {i}: {percentage}%")
    print(f"Total CPU Usage: {psutil.cpu_percent()}%")

psutil's cpu_count() function returns number of cores, whereas cpu_freq() function returns CPU frequency as a namedtuple including current, min and max frequency expressed in Mhz, you can set percpu=True to get per CPU frequency.

cpu_percent() method returns a float representing the current CPU utilization as a percentage, setting interval to 1 (seconds) will compare system CPU times elapsed before and after a second, we set percpu to True in order to get CPU usage of each core.

# Memory Information

    print("="*40, "Memory Information", "="*40)
    svmem = psutil.virtual_memory()
    print(f"Total: {get_size(svmem.total)}")
    print(f"Available: {get_size(svmem.available)}")
    print(f"Used: {get_size(svmem.used)}")
    print(f"Percentage: {svmem.percent}%")
    print("="*20, "SWAP", "="*20)
    swap = psutil.swap_memory()
    print(f"Total: {get_size(swap.total)}")
    print(f"Free: {get_size(swap.free)}")
    print(f"Used: {get_size(swap.used)}")
    print(f"Percentage: {swap.percent}%")

virtual_memory() method returns stats about system memory usage as a namedtuple, including fields such as total (total physical memory available), available (available memory, i.e not used), used and percent (i.e percentage). swap_memory() is the same but for swap memory.

We used the previously defined get_size() function to print values in a scaled manner, as these statistics are expressed in bytes.

# Disk Usage

    print("="*40, "Disk Information", "="*40)
    print("Partitions and Usage:")
    # get all disk partitions
    partitions = psutil.disk_partitions()
    for partition in partitions:
        print(f"=== Device: {partition.device} ===")
        print(f"  Mountpoint: {partition.mountpoint}")
        print(f"  File system type: {partition.fstype}")
        try:
            partition_usage = psutil.disk_usage(partition.mountpoint)
        except PermissionError:
            # this can be catched due to the disk that
            # isn't ready
            continue
        print(f"  Total Size: {get_size(partition_usage.total)}")
        print(f"  Used: {get_size(partition_usage.used)}")
        print(f"  Free: {get_size(partition_usage.free)}")
        print(f"  Percentage: {partition_usage.percent}%")
    # get IO statistics since boot
    disk_io = psutil.disk_io_counters()
    print(f"Total read: {get_size(disk_io.read_bytes)}")
    print(f"Total write: {get_size(disk_io.write_bytes)}")

As expected, disk_usage() function return disk usage statistics as a namedtuple, including total, used and free space expressed in bytes.
Network Information

# Network information

    print("="*40, "Network Information", "="*40)
    # get all network interfaces (virtual and physical)
    if_addrs = psutil.net_if_addrs()
    for interface_name, interface_addresses in if_addrs.items():
        for address in interface_addresses:
            print(f"=== Interface: {interface_name} ===")
            if str(address.family) == 'AddressFamily.AF_INET':
                print(f"  IP Address: {address.address}")
                print(f"  Netmask: {address.netmask}")
                print(f"  Broadcast IP: {address.broadcast}")
            elif str(address.family) == 'AddressFamily.AF_PACKET':
                print(f"  MAC Address: {address.address}")
                print(f"  Netmask: {address.netmask}")
                print(f"  Broadcast MAC: {address.broadcast}")
    # get IO statistics since boot
    net_io = psutil.net_io_counters()
    print(f"Total Bytes Sent: {get_size(net_io.bytes_sent)}")
    print(f"Total Bytes Received: {get_size(net_io.bytes_recv)}")

net_if_addrs() function return the addresses associated to each network interface card installed on the system.
